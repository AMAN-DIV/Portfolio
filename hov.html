             There’s an inexplicable desire to travel and trek in Pachmarhi, the ‘Queen of the Satpuras’, when the rays of the sun are still peeking out, especially on a bright and clear March morning. The fresh air was fragrant of pine and wildflowers and there was a refreshing sense of thrill bubbling inside me.
             <br>
        
             <br><b>The Beginning of the Journey</b><br/><span>The very first site from where the Pocmarhi trek embarked was the sparkling Pachmarhi Cantonment where I was to meet my guide who turned out to be quite an adept person in the region and quite passionate about it. He had a broad grin on his face with a strut and was narrating the tales about the history of the place and its extensive flora and fauna. And all of a sudden, as if a dam broke in my chest, I was ready to walk the twisting and turning paths.</span><br>

        In no time, the path led us into thick greenery where even the sun had to break in using the penetrating rays wondrously composed of clashing shades of light and darkness. Many curves in the path brought us to the stunning Bee Fall with its crystal-like waters of the early sun sparkling over the moving waters. The cool, rejuvenating waters so inviting, begging me to swim in them washing away all the weariness that was inside me, replenishing me.
        
        Crossing, climbing through the settlements of the farmers and over various landscapes of terraced tea plantation, we scrambled to higher elevations-thousands of feet above sea level and even further. It was now time to climb out of the river valley suitable for large-scale vegetative cover as well as climb over mountains that rose to almost 4000 metrs. From some peaks the clouds appeared to consume all views.
        
        We were encumbered with physical work that now and the geography revealed that it opened so many breathtaking sites in it. The subsequent target was Dhupgarh, in other words, the mountain peak of Madhya Pradesh. We both were so much high that every step was bringing us nearer and nearer to the clouds. When we finally arrive.
